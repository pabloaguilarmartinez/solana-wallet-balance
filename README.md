# Solana Wallet Balance

## Challenge 03 from Doge Academy.
Create a web application using React that integrates with the Solana Wallet Adapter. The application should allow the 
user to connect their Solana wallet and display the current SOL balance in the connected wallet.

### Requirements
- Use React to create the application.
- Integrate the Solana Wallet Adapter to allow users to connect their Solana wallet to the application.
- Once the wallet is connected, use the Solana web3.js library to fetch and display the current SOL balance in the 
connected wallet.

## Stack
- TypeScript
- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS

## Considerations
The web is up and running on: [https://pam-solana-wallet-balance.vercel.app/](https://pam-solana-wallet-balance.vercel.app/).
We are using the Solana devnet, so it shows the balance of SOL on the devnet.
